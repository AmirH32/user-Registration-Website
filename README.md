# user-Registration-Website
This website allows users to create an account, login to an account and logout of an account. It uses html, css and django.

To run:
- Extract the contents of your OnePage.zip file to the django project file.
- Create a folder in your django project file called "static".
- Move the assets folder located within OnePage to static to allow django to render the css, javascript and images.
